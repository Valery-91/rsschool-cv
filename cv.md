### About me:
I have been working for 7 years as an engineer of automatic control systems. By education, I am a system administrator and I learned all the skills necessary for successful work on my own directly in the process of work and some trainings. I am also engaged in the creation of hmi interfaces.
I want to change the field of activity by taking up front-end development. The ability to learn and experience in a similar field will help me achieve success.
